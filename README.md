NetShare app
==============================
## Why develop this app? <br>
Many people like sharing pictures with others sometimes.However, large platforms such as GoogleDrive and OneDrive have a fee system. Users need to pay a monthly fee to use a larger capacity, otherwise they can only use 5GB of space for free. Also, users cannot see other people's pictures if they use these platforms. As a result, we developed this app. If you're looking for an app where you can log in to upload pictures at any time and see pictures posted by everyone, give this app a try! <br>
